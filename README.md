# LavaCake Library

This library aims to simplify the usage of Vulkan.

## Warning
I conceived this Library while learning Vulkan hopping to use it for my own experiments.
In consequence the code architecture might change drasticly as my understanding of Vulkan evolve.

However if you dare use it, I'd be happy to listen to your feedback :).


## Credits

The core of this library is based on the Vulkan Cookbook code.  

The code repository for [Vulkan Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/vulkan-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786468154), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/).
